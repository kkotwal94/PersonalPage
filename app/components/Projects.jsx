Most importantly it was made so a Manager can select his employees, and add them under his jurisdiction, and then assign them reports.

The admin can add violations based off user or vehicle information, the admin can also edit profiles and select slots for users to stop at. The admin can most importantly add violations and notes, whether they have the user or not. If the user is not determined when adding a violation, the admin may assign a vehicle a violation, and then a vehicle to a user when they figure it out who the violation belongs to. The user may do all the same but they cannot edit info like parking lot #, or tag #s. They can however have multiple vehicles and select the one that is currently in use. If you decide to pull it, create some users, and create a user with the id Admin, In the demo the admin login credentials admin, 123";
